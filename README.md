This was my attempt at a navigation bar wih dropdown menus and a mobile menu, which are displayed/alternated in accordance with changing viewport dimensions, combined into a single module, which can be used as a template for my future portfolio website and adapted as needed. I also added some other visual elements to incorporate into my site, which create a nice backdrop for the content.  

I was prompted to code this project by an Odin Project lesson: https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/dynamic-user-interface-interactions

I was inspired by the styling of the following website: https://www.beatthestreetsuk.com/

The various code branches feature different variations of the same content.

I have published this code package on npm as my first module: https://www.npmjs.com/package/slidedownmenu-responsive
